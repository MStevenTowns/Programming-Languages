::=S*S|S+S|S-S|A
A::=a|b
this is ambigous, more than 1 way to get same string
a-b+a
can have more than 1 tree
make it non-ambigous
S::=S*S
S::=S+S
S::=S-S
S::=A
A::=a|b

S::=S*T|T
T::=T+E|E
E::=E-A|A
A::=a|b

if recursive terminal is on left, it is left recursive, left association
if recursice terminal is on right, it is right recursive, right association

if it is left associated, use left recursion
you want trees growing on left
the closer a rule is to the terminal, the sooner it gets done(so if adding the mult symbol is the last step, it will be in "()")

S::=S-T|T
T::=T+E|E
E::=E*A|A
A::=a|b

why is left recursion bad, it goes forever without evaluating on right
