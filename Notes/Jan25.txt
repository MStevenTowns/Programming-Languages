inherently ambigous - cannot remove ambigouity

test: short & long answer
a few(almost none) T/F

hist: not very important
get chonology, not dates
what language was OOP

interpreter vs compiler
statement by statement

compiler vs assembler
assembler is a compiler
transates intermed to binary

bnf object or meta?
Meta - defines other languages

is elim L rec necicary
yes, if parse l to R
S->Sa|B|c
becomes
S->BS'|cS'
S'->aS'|^

is __ a cfg
rules
1 non-term on left
no term on left
productions
Terminals lowercase
non-terminals uppercase
separated by |
::= or ->

parse LL1 table

fix non-deterministic

know First&Follow
going to be confusing

syntax diagram
<exp>::=<factor>|<exp>+<factor>
circles and boxes

S=A+B|A-B
B=b|Sb|^
A=a

First S: a
		Follow S:$,b
First A: a
		Follow A:+,-
First B:b,^,a
		Follow B:$,b
LL1 for ^^^^^

	a		b		+		-		$
S	1,2		
B	4		3,5						5
A	a
INVALID(mult options)
if a first goes to null then use the follow instead
