Formal Definitio:
{ E,S, F, I, T}
S - states
F-Final
I-Initial
T-transitions
E-should be summation symbol - alphabet

arrow pointin in is a start 
double circle is final state
subset construction - create a new one for the same language to make it simpeler
minimization - collapse into fewest possible lines
